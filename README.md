# Data-Analysis-Projects

These projects demonstrate working through all stages of a data solution lifecycle, to include
- analyze/profile data
- create data models 
- architect and design ETL
- reporting and analytics
I have attempted to work with the largest datasets I can while drawing inferences and preparing insights in narrative or visual forms.
